# `mdv` A simple Markdown viewer

This is a minimal wrapper around
[`blackfridaytext`](https://github.com/gholt/blackfridaytext), which
is a text renderer for the [Blackfriday Markdown
Processor](https://github.com/russross/blackfriday).

It excepts just one argument, the markdown file to render:

```
mdv README.md | less
```
