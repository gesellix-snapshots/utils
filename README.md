This is a repository where I dump miscellaneous utilities and other
code. Some of it is work in progress.

- [`crosvm`](./crosvm): Dockerfile/Makefile to compile
  [`crosvm`](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromiumos/platform/crosvm/).
- [`photo`](./photo): A collection of scripts to manage meta-data and
  other things for scanned films/photos.
- [`rpncalc`](./rpncalc): A text based calculator (written in Python),
  which uses Reverse Polish Notation (like HP pocket
  calculators). It's also handy for low level work as it prints
  numbers in decimal, hex, and binary.
- [`mdv`](./mdv): A super simple text markdown viewer.
- [`npterm`](./win-npterm): A simple terminal utility (written in Go)
  which connects to a Named Pipe. It optionally logs all output to a
  file. I use this for serial console access to Hyper-V VMs.
